        <b>Steel structures</b>
        <p>
          Self-supporting, white powder-coated steel frame. The geodesic dome method enables the creation of lightweight, spacious, yet exceptionally stable structures. The main advantage of geodesic domes is the even stress distribution across all frame nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          SonoDome pavilions require no poles, load-bearing walls, or internal columns, ensuring maximum usable space for the client. The use of steel structural elements makes the domes highly resistant to weather conditions and loads, extending their lifespan even through multiple installation and dismantling cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each geodesic dome structure by SonoDome is engineered based on precise load calculations. This ensures both safety and durability. Our structural engineers can also calculate the peak loads of suspended equipment for every dome model.

        <b>Membranes</b>
        <p>
          We use only the highest quality PVC fabrics for our geodesic dome covers, sourced from leading manufacturers in Germany and Belgium. All fabrics are certified and comply with European quality and fire safety standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eco Dome covers are known for their strength and durability. Thanks to dense weaving, the material resists punctures, scratches, and cuts while remaining easy to clean. Covers are available in a wide range of colors, with snow white being the most popular option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possible cover options for portable dome structures include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Transparent PVC fabric</b> – allows excellent light transmission and refraction, illuminating the entire dome. Projections are visible both inside and outside the dome tent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Blackout PP laminated canvas</b> – ideal for dome projections. Blocks 99% of visible light and solar heat, preventing overheating during hot summer days.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <b>Floor and decking</b>
        <p>
          We designed a modular decking system consisting of a rigid frame and prefabricated panels for quick and easy installation. The SonoDome modular floor system also conceals and protects cables and wiring, while compensating for slopes and uneven ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          The floor can be finished with carpet, laminate, linoleum, or modular PVC panels, depending on the client’s needs.

        <b>Entry, Doors</b>
        <p>
          Standard domes include a single round door that blends seamlessly with the dome’s shape, available in transparent or opaque PVC fabric with a zipper closure. The doorway can be opened fully by removing the door in just a few minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dome can feature up to 5 doorways, which can connect to other domes or serve as additional entrances and exits for large gatherings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon request, fabric doors can be replaced with other types of doors as required by the client.

        <b>Connecting tunnels</b>
        <p>
          All SonoDome structures can be interconnected using special cylindrical tunnel walkways. 
          A cluster of connected domes creates a unique sense of space and allows organizers to divide the event infrastructure into themed sections — for example, separating exhibition stands while maintaining a unified structure.
